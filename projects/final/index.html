                <p>The music industry has seen it time and time again. Boy bands break up and their members go on to
                    start solo careers.</p>
                <p>Two famous boy bands, *NSYNC and One Direction had successful careers before they broke up. From both
                    bands emerged solo stars, such as Harry Styles and Justin Timberlake.</p>
                <p>*NSYNC formed in 1995 and was made up of five members: Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Lance Bass, Joey
                    Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick, according to the band's website. They released four albums and
                    completed five nationwide concert tours, according to Wikipedia.</p>
                <p>Two of the former members, Timberlake and Chasez, started solo careers.</p>

            <h2>Top 10 Hits</h2>
            <p>When considering the success of the bands and solo careers, it is also important to consider the amount
                of songs that reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 over their time as artists.</p>
            <p>*NSYNC achieved six top 10 hits during their nine-year career according to Billboard, averaging one
                every 1.5 years. Justin Timberlake has had 19 songs in the top 10 over his 23-year solo career, roughly
                one every year and a few months. JC Chasez has never had a song in the top 10.</p>
            <iframe title="Number of Top 10 Hits in Career" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-CvHIa"

            </script>
            <p>During One Direction's five year career, Billboard reported they had six top 10 hits, meaning they
                averaged over one top ten hit for each year of their career. Harry Styles shares a similar statistic as
                during his career so far, which has been seven years, he has had seven songs reach the top 10. Liam
                Payne only had one top 10 hit during his six year career.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While not the only factor, this data can indicate that the original success of the solo members can be
                partially attributed to the fame they gained during their time as boy band members. However, they
                also put in work themselves to grow into the stars they are today.</p>
