                    <p>The music industry has seen it time and time again. Boy bands break up and their members go on to
                        start solo careers.</p>
                    <p>Two famous boy bands, *NSYNC and One Direction had successful careers before they broke up. From
                        both bands emerged solo stars, such as Harry Styles and Justin Timberlake.</p>
                    <p>*NSYNC formed in 1995 and was made up of five members: Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Lance Bass,
                        Joey Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick. They released six albums and completed five nationwide
                        concert tours.</p>
                    <p>The band has sold over 70 million records, making them one of the best-selling boy bands of all
                        time. Two of the former members, Timberlake and Chasez, started solo careers.</p>

                    <p>One Direction made music for six years beginning in 2010. The band’s members were Harry Styles,
                        Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik. Malik left the band prior to the
                        breakup in 2015 for personal reasons.</p>
                    <p>They released five albums and went on four world tours during their career. After the breakup all
                        members started solo careers. This article will focus on the careers of Harry Styles and Liam
                        Payne.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>In the first two years of their career, *NSYNC appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 Top 50 for approximately
                70
                weeks. Their first song in the Top 50 came on March 7, 1998, when "I Want You Back" reached number 25.
                Over
                this
                period, four different songs charted, with their highest peak being number 2 for "Music of My Heart."

            <h2>Top 10 Hits</h2>
            <p>When considering the success of the bands and solo careers, it is also important to consider the amount
                of
                songs that reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 over their time as artists.</p>
            <p>*NSYNC achieved six top 10 hits during their nine-year career, averaging one every 1.5 years. Justin
                Timberlake has had 19 songs in the top 10 over his 23-year solo career, roughly one every year and a few
                months. JC Chasez has never had a song in the top 10.</p>

            </script>
            <p>During One Direction's five year career, they had six top 10 hits, meaning they averaged over one top ten
                hit
                for each year of their career. Harry Styles shares a similar statistic as during his career so far,
                which
                has been seven years, he has had seven songs reach the top 10. Liam Payne only had one top 10 hit during
                his
                six year career.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>While not the only factor, this data can indicate that the original success of the solo members can be
                partially attributed to the fame they gained during their time as boy band members. However, the two
                also
                put in work themselves to grow into the stars they are today.</p>
