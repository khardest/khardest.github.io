                <p>UMD early action decisions just released and with that came many new students receiving scholarships. Maryland gives out thousands of dollars every year to students, including winners of the Banneker/Key scholarship. This is the most prestigious scholarship the university awards. Many people at UMD don’t know the students who are actually winning these scholarships. I would like to introduce them to my friend Naomi, who is one of these students.</p>
